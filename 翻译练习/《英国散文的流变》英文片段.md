《英国散文的流放》-第二章 英文《圣经》的文学成就
In the beginngin God created the heaven and the earth

And the earth was without form,and void;and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

And the Spirit of God moved the face of waters.

And God said,Let there be light: and there was ligh.

And God saw the light,that is was  good: and God
divided the light form the darkness.

And God called the light Day,and the darkness he called Night.
and the evening and the moring were the first day.
